# Smart Energy Conservation

This project recognizes a major area of electricity wastage. It is often noticed that lights may remain on at full intensity when not required, cooling units operate for unduly long periods and processing units work despite complete production.

The project provides the functionality to control the lighting and cooling, and operate the production units based on the requirements.
